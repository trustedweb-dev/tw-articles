      Issue the achievement of activities in the mutual help app as a digital
      certificate. Verify the authenticity of the achievement by VC signature to
      enhance the supporter’s trust. In particular, VC issued by mutual help app
      A will be verified by other mutual help app B.

      With demonstration on system planning and development, we realized the
      needs to “clarify security concerns” and required “private key recovery
      method of users”. With clarifying security concerns, we studied concerns
      on both VC and DID. We sorted out 4&nbsp;directions based on result of
      ID-ideal research of Germany, namely,&nbsp;“recovery by oneself” ,
      ”intensive recovery”, ”recovery by the trusted third”, “not recoverable
      (no recovery)”. We plan to adopt an ”intensive recovery” method by using
      Cloud Wallet

    <span style="color: black">
      With demonstration on business model, there are 4 issues on “safety”,
      “awareness”, “continued use (incentive) “and “monetize”. By building echo
      system of mutual help app, we can contribute “safety” and “continued use
      (incentive) “.
    </span>

  <li>
    <span style="color: black">
      With demonstration on the formulation of Mutual help trust framework, we
      studied&nbsp;“A. clarify items of mutual help trust framework”, “B.
      meaning of the formulation of mutual help trust framework”, “C. clarify
      the role of each stakeholder”, “D. Issues on the formulation of Mutual
      help trust framework”. We will continue study on the item D as there are
      still issues on trust certification criteria and UI/UX of app used by
      actual users.
