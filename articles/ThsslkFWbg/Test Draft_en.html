<p><span style="color:#4682b4">Hiragana occurs more often at the end of sentences, rather in clumps of 1 to 4 chars rather than just single chars. Katakana is very unlikely to appear as a single character in Japanese text, but hiragana could. Exclamation and question marks are "double-byte", not standard ascii ones.&nbsp;</span></p>
